Variable Selection in Data Envelopment Analysis and more

## Project description

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) seeks to compare the relative efficiency of a group's decision units (DMU).

This R package provides additional features to support variable selection, restricted DEA models, and leverage analysis.

The selection of variables in DEA is a cornerstone, because efficiency results hardly depend on that selection. A measured, called load, allows handling that selection. In the package to do it two step-by-step functions are provided.

Sometimes the reasons for external analysis require that the contributions of variables to the DEA be restricted in a range. Another function is also provided for this purpose.

Another feature provided allows us to find which DMUs cause the most significant changes in the results so that we can handle them properly.
